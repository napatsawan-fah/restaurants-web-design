                        <p class="card-text">The 'Ship Restaurant Bar and Lounge' is concealed at the back and to the side of the Amrit Science College Campus and next to Hotel Norbu Linka. The impressive facade leads one to believe they are on a 'ship on shore' and the tasteful modern decor of its many rooms on different decks will help ensure that this restaurant will establish new standards. The Ship will provide a new dining experience with Nepal.<br>
                          Shades of creams and browns along with the signature blue lighting of its owner Mr Sagar Pandey induce a relaxing environment. This is complemented by the executive chef Mr Padam Magar formerly of the Hotel Shangri La and his team who will greet your warmly on arrival and care for you during your stay with us.

                          When the sun shines, which is often in Kathmandu, our delicious food can be served to our rooftop garden, on our upper decks and our main promenade. This provides a more casual approach to the Ship's dining experience and there are spaces for over 60 diners to enjoy the Kathmandu sunshine. Our main restaurant rooms provide comfort for all our guests in well spaced and uncluttered tables. Our menu has been designed so that all food can be prepared from fresh and delivered to the table within 30 minutes of ordering.<br>
                          All foods whenever possible are organically produced from local sources and will be served by young, enthusiastic and motivated people. Most are students taking their diplomas at a local Hotel Management college and it is the founders aim to help the education of the young.The Ship will assist in this education and will help promote the empowerment of women by providing a vehicle for on the job training and learning as well as providing in house development.

                          Our emphasis will be on quality. Quality of food, quality of service and quality of surroundings, this emphasis will not be compromised. We believe that dining at 'The Ship' will be an unforgettable experience unrivalled in Kathmandu and we look forward to pushing the culinary boundaries of the dining culture within Nepal.<br></p>
